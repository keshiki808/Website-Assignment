<h2>Premise</h2>
<blockquote><p>
The story begins with the murder of Laura Palmer, a teenaged girl who lived in the quiet town of Twin Peaks,
 near the US - Canadian borders. Everyone seems surprised and devastated by the girl's murder, and the town's 
 sherif welcomes the help of FBI agent Dale Cooper, who comes to investigate the case. As Cooper begins his search 
 for Laura's killer, the town's secrets are gradually exposed. This is definitely not an average quiet town, it seems
as everyone has something big to hide, During the nights, agent Cooper sees strange visions of Laura and other mysterious people,
 visions that tell him that something big is happening here, something far more evil than a single murder case...("Twin peaks (TV series 1990–1991)," n.d.)

    The show's narrative draws on elements of detective fiction, but its uncanny tone, supernatural elements, and campy, 
    melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also pays homage to American soap opera and horror tropes.
    Like much of Lynch's work, it is distinguished by surrealism, offbeat humor, and distinctive cinematography. The score was 
    composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch.(Wikipedia, 2021)

<p>Since the broadcast of the pilot episode, Twin Peaks earned widespread critical acclaim. The 
    first season earned thirteen Emmy Award nominations—of which it won two awards—a Directors Guild of America Award nomination,
     and won a Casting Society of America Award, two Golden Globe Awards and two Grammy Awards.(Wikipedia, 2021)
